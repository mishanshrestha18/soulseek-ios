/// Regression tests for the audit's claim that an upload row landing on
/// `.queued` (peer accepted but is queueing us) becomes inert. Without
/// the round-3 fix, `handleTransferResponse` set the row to `.queued`
/// but neither re-inserted into `uploadQueue` nor scheduled a retry, so
/// nothing drove the transfer forward unless the peer happened to send
/// a follow-up TransferRequest. The fix routes `.queued` rejects through
/// `scheduleUploadRetry`, which sleeps the backoff ladder and re-attempts
/// via `retryUploadInternal`.
