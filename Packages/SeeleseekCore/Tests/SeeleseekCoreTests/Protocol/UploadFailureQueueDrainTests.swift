/// Regression: every upload-failure exit must call `processQueue()` so the
/// freed concurrency slot is reused immediately. Pre-round-1 fix, four
/// failure paths in `UploadManager` removed `pendingTransfers` /
/// `activeUploads` but skipped `processQueue()`, so queued uploads sat
/// idle even though the slot was free. The round-1 fix introduced
/// `failUploadAttempt` as the single point that bundles cleanup +
/// `processQueue()`; this test asserts that contract via a test seam.
