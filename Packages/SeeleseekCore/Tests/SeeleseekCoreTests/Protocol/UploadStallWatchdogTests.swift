/// frozen at e.g. 30% indefinitely because `NWConnection.send` waits
/// forever for a callback that never fires. The helper races the send
/// against a `Task.sleep` and throws `UploadError.timeout` if the send
/// hasn't completed by the deadline. The error string ("Transfer timed
/// out") is retriable per the classifier — see UploadRetryClassifierTests.
